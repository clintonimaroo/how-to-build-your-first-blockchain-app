# How to build your first blockchain app
I will be walking you through the steps you need to take to get started with blockchain development.

First off, let's talk about what a blockchain app is. Simply put, a blockchain app is a piece of software that runs on a blockchain network. This network is a decentralized, distributed ledger that allows multiple parties to securely and transparently store and access data.

Building a blockchain app can seem daunting at first, but it's actually not too difficult once you understand the basics.

## Getting Started

- Choose a blockchain platform. There are several different platforms out there, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular choices include Ethereum, EOS, and Hyperledger.
- Set up a development environment. This will typically involve installing the necessary software and tools, such as a blockchain platform, a code editor, and a local blockchain network.
- Learn the basics of smart contract development. A smart contract is a piece of code that runs on a blockchain and defines the rules and conditions for a transaction. You'll need to learn a programming language like Solidity to write your own smart contracts.
- Develop your app. This will involve writing the code for your app, testing it, and deploying it to the blockchain network.
- Test and debug your app. It's important to thoroughly test your app to ensure that it works as intended and is secure. You may need to use tools like debuggers and testnets to help you find and fix any issues.


Once you've completed these steps, you'll have built your first blockchain app! Of course, there's a lot more to learn and explore in the world of blockchain development.
